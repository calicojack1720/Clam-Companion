Clam Companion seeks to automate common utilities in Clam AV in an effort to encourage the use of Clam AV and learn more about how antivirus works. This project will focus on an
implementation for Linux, as it is where Clam Av is most effective, however could be adapted for use on Windows or MacOS in the future.
