Clam Companion seeks to automate common utilities in Clam AV in an effort to encourage the use of Clam AV and learn more about how antivirus works. This project will focus on an
implementation for Linux, as it is where Clam Av is most effective, however could be adapted for use on Windows or MacOS in the future.

I am currently writing Clam Companion in Rust. Why Rust you ask? Could it be for the amazing benefits of Rust that make it the abosolute best and most full-proof option for coding
anything that exists in the world aside from front-end web development that makes every other programming language instantly obsolete? I am sorry to inform the world's Rustaceans that this is unfortunately not the case, I just kind of felt like using Rust and wanted to learn more about using the langauge.

Clam Companion will focus on the most common utilities, such as setting up common configuration files with the press of a button as well as scanning files and directories and general management of running Clam AV. While it is not very hard to get a basic Clam AV scan up and running, it is my hope that by working on this project I can both improve my own programming skills while learning more about how AV and malware detection works.

# Why Clam AV?

The short answer is that you should probably not be using Clam AV as your main antivirus. The long answer is though that modern AV programs are chocked full of bloatware that can slow down your coputer, roots itself in your system in invasive ways, constantly bothers you with ads and alerts, [and may even be collecting and selling your data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_bans_and_allegations_of_Russian_government_ties). In other words, big AV has become the very thing it swore to destroy. In contrast, Clam AV is lightweight, open-source, and customizable. While it may lag behind new changes in virus definitions, I think that Clam AV provides an interesting opportunity for us to learn more about the tools we use. While Clam AV may not serve as a good commercial AV, it's definitely still worth a look!
